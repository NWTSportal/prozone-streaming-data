# prozone-streaming-data
Includes all the scripts for extracting the data from Prozone for BPL. It includes files for extracting data specifically for team, players, encounters and as well as a file which does all the extraction at the same time. We get the output in xml and we also have a batch file which does a xml to csv conversion in this repo.
